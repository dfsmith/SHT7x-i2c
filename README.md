# SHT7x-i2c

Arduino library for reading Sensirion SHT7x and SHT1x temperature/humidity
sensors.

I wrote a C library for the Sensirion sensors many years ago.  None of the
existing Arduino SHT7x library modules worked when I tried to use them with
the Espressif ESP32, so this is a small C++ encapsulation of the older
library.
